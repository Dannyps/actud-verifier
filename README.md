# ACTUD Verifier

name open for debate.

## Context

Have you ever found a Portuguese invoice that could not be loaded into the E-Fatura App? Or maybe you're curious about all the information hiding in that cute QR code? This app will help read and reencode the QR Code in Portuguese invoices.

## Contributions

This project is not currently accepting contributions.

## ADCTUD Library

It is increasingly obvious that the ACTUD files should be reusable by other projects. However, in line with this code's license, such is not foreseen.

## Startup
